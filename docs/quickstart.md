# ðŸš€ Quick Start With GitHub Pages

There are several ways to configure the
[GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site),
I would recommend to use the `docs` folder option, as you can keep source code
and documentation together in the master branch.

With that in mind, there are only three steps required to get your docs up an
running with this theme:

1. Add your documentation markdown files into a docs folder at the root of your
  repository.
1. Select your publishing source in the GitHub repository settings as indicated
  in [the official documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

And that's it!
